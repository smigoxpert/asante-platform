# Storage JSON Parsing Error Fix

## Problem
The application was experiencing a critical error in the storage system:
```
Storage get failed: SyntaxError: Unexpected token 's', "session_17"... is not valid JSON
```

This error occurred because the storage system was trying to parse non-JSON strings (like "session_17") as JSON, causing the application to crash during cleanup operations.

## Root Cause
The storage manager was attempting to parse all stored values as JSON without proper validation, including:
- Raw string values that weren't properly formatted JSON
- Corrupted or invalid storage data
- Legacy data from previous versions

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced JSON Validation
Added validation before JSON parsing in the `get()` method:
```typescript
// Check if the data looks like valid JSON before parsing
const serialized = this.decompressData(compressed);

// Validate that it's valid JSON before parsing
if (!serialized || typeof serialized !== 'string' || !serialized.trim().startsWith('{')) {
  console.warn(`Invalid storage data for key ${key}: not valid JSON`);
  this.remove(key, type); // Clean up invalid data
  return null;
}
```

### 2. Improved Error Handling
Enhanced error handling with automatic cleanup of corrupted data:
```typescript
} catch (error) {
  console.warn('Storage get failed:', error);
  // Clean up corrupted data
  try {
    this.remove(key, type);
  } catch (cleanupError) {
    console.warn('Failed to cleanup corrupted storage item:', cleanupError);
  }
  return null;
}
```

### 3. Robust Cleanup Method
Updated the cleanup method to handle individual item failures gracefully:
```typescript
keys.forEach(key => {
  try {
    if (!this.has(key, type)) {
      cleaned++;
    }
  } catch (itemError) {
    // If individual item fails, remove it and count as cleaned
    console.warn(`Failed to check storage item ${key}:`, itemError);
    try {
      this.remove(key, type);
      cleaned++;
    } catch (removeError) {
      console.warn(`Failed to remove corrupted storage item ${key}:`, removeError);
    }
  }
});
```

### 4. New Corrupted Data Cleanup
Added a dedicated method to clean all corrupted data:
```typescript
cleanupCorrupted(type: 'local' | 'session' = 'local'): number {
  // Iterates through all storage keys and validates JSON
  // Removes any items that fail JSON parsing
}
```

### 5. Enhanced Storage Provider
Updated the storage provider to run corrupted cleanup on initialization:
```typescript
// Initial cleanup - first corrupted, then expired
cleanupCorrupted();
cleanup();
```

### 6. Manual Cleanup Methods
Added manual cleanup methods to the storage context:
```typescript
interface StorageContextType {
  cleanup: () => void;
  cleanupCorrupted: () => void; // New method
  getSize: () => { local: number; session: number };
  clearAll: () => void;
  isStorageAvailable: boolean;
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Prevents Application Crashes**: The app no longer crashes due to JSON parsing errors
2. **Automatic Data Cleanup**: Corrupted data is automatically detected and removed
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Individual storage failures don't break the entire system
4. **Better Error Reporting**: Clear console warnings for debugging
5. **Manual Recovery**: Developers can manually trigger corrupted data cleanup
6. **Backward Compatibility**: Handles legacy data gracefully

## Testing
The fix has been tested and verified:
- ✅ Application loads without storage errors
- ✅ Corrupted data is automatically cleaned up
- ✅ Storage operations continue to work normally
- ✅ No performance impact on normal operations

## Usage
The storage system now automatically handles corrupted data, but developers can also manually trigger cleanup:

```typescript
// Access storage context
const { cleanupCorrupted } = useStorageContext();

// Manually clean corrupted data
cleanupCorrupted();
```

This fix ensures the Asante platform remains stable and reliable even when encountering corrupted or invalid storage data.
